- move to REST API (internal one is getting deprecated)
- store per-BU micro-completion. Possibly package more information about missing FUs
- deduplication (also consider timeout adjustement in anelastic)? maybe inject id for fu-out documents?
- analysis of eols, prc-in and fu-out information to detect FU which is problematic
- use xml etree to get runriver jar and elasticsearch version from pom.xml
